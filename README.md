# Islandora REST Extras

## Introduction

Utility module that provides options for objects ingested via Islandora's REST interface. Currently, it only provides a way to regenerate the DC of each ingested object, effectively emulating the behavior of objects ingested using Islandora's web interface or standard batch tools.

> This module was originally named 'islandora_rest_ingester_extras' but was renamed 'islandora_rest_extras' on January 9, 2018.
